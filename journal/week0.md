- Create a DVCS account(GitHub Account): I already have one.
- Create CDE account: I have created Gitpod Account, and i'm planing to activate Github Codespaces Account once reaching the Gitpod free tier limit.
- Create a AWS account: Succsfully created with the free tier.
- Custom Domain Name: One concediration that should be taken in account as highlitedin the outline document is to ensure that the domain provider allows you to update the nameservers, so we can point the domain to AWS namespaces.
- Diagramming application: Created a free Lucidchart account, so we can drow our Conceptual/Napkin, Logical and physical diagrams.
